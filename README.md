## Introduction
Networking commands via the command-line interface (CLI) are crucial tools for IT professionals.  
They provide insight into system configurations, assist in troubleshooting connectivity issues, and help analyze network performance across different platforms such as Windows and Linux.

This repository links to a hands-on tutorial that covers commands like:

- `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `ip a`
- `netstat`, `ss`
- `ping`, `tracert`, `mtr`
- `nslookup`, `host`, `dig`
- `arp`, `route`, `hostname`

Each command includes practical examples and scenarios.
